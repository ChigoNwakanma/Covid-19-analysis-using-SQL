--COVID-19 EXPLORATORY ANALYSIS
--The COVID-19 dataset spreadsheet was split and saved as 2 different sheets; covid_deaths & covid_vax

--Checking to see that all the columns were uploaded correctly
SELECT *

--Pulling the main columns that will be used for analysis
SELECT 
  Location, date, total_cases, new_cases, total_deaths, population

ORDER BY 1, 2

--Exploring the likelihood of dying if you contract COVID in a specific country
--Looking at Total cases vs total deaths

FROM `portfolio1-337505.covid_data.covid_deaths`
WHERE location = "Canada" 
AND ((total_deaths/total_cases)*100) > 2.0 AND date BETWEEN '2021-01-01' and '2022-01-01' --this line adds more filters by date and death %
ORDER BY 1, 2

--Looking at the Total cases vs the population for CANADA
--this shows what %age of population got COVID as the days progress
SELECT

FROM `portfolio1-337505.covid_data.covid_deaths`

--Looking at countries with highest infection rates compared to population
SELECT

FROM `portfolio1-337505.covid_data.covid_deaths`
GROUP BY 1, 2

--Showing the countries with the highest mortality rates, grouped by location

 --INSIGHT: When looking at the death counts by continents, Africa ranks 5th, which makes sense cos the infection count ranks 5th as well
 --but when we compare the death and infection counts WRT population, things look a bit different. Ordering by "Percent_mortality" and "percent_population_infected" 
 --will show that Africa ranks 2nd in infection rates by population and 6th(lowest) in Percent_mortality



--EXPLORING FROM A GLOBAL VIEWPOINT
--Looking at Death % on each recorded date(excluding days with 0 cases to avoid division error)
--we can observe that the death percentage rises gradually up until mid-april 2020, then begins to drop.
--some outliers occur in feb 2020 with some dates having over 20% death %

WHERE location IS NOT NULL AND new_cases != 0

--NOW JOINING BOTH THE DEATHS AND VAX TABLES TO SEE THE EFFECT OF THE VACCINATIONS

SELECT *
FROM `portfolio1-337505.covid_data.covid_deaths` AS Deaths

  AND Deaths.date = Vax.date
WHERE deaths.continent IS NOT NULL 
AND Vax.location = "Canada"  --this line adds a filter by location(country)
ORDER BY 2, 3 


--NOW IF WE WANTED A ROLLING COUNT OF THE TOTAL NUMBER OF VACCINATIONS DONE, WE HAVE TO USE A "PARTITION" COMMAND
--"PARTITION BY" CLAUSE is usually used in conjunction with an aggregate fn to create a new column which makes reference to/is derived from an existing column.
--so below, we have been able to create a new column  "RollingCount_NewVax", which contains the sum of the previous "Vax.new_vaccinations" rows, GIVEN they belong in the same "location"
--hence, each time a new location is reached in the order, the count begins from zero and begins to add up for that specific location
--Check out the use of partition with the LEAD/LAG aggregate fns online. Quite Interesting!!!

SELECT
  Deaths.continent, Deaths.location, Deaths.date, Deaths.population, Vax.new_vaccinations, 
SUM(Vax.new_vaccinations) OVER (PARTITION BY Deaths.location ORDER BY Deaths.location, Deaths.date) AS RollingCount_NewVax
FROM `portfolio1-337505.covid_data.covid_deaths` AS Deaths
JOIN `portfolio1-337505.covid_data.covid_vax` AS Vax
  ON Deaths.location = Vax.Location 
  AND Deaths.date = Vax.date
WHERE deaths.continent IS NOT NULL 
ORDER BY 2, 3 

--Using the MAX fn with that rolling count, and comparing that to the total population, 
--we can find how many people are vaccinated in each country as of the latest date recorded
SELECT 
  Deaths.continent, Deaths.location, Deaths.date, Deaths.population, Vax.new_vaccinations, 
  SUM(Vax.new_vaccinations) OVER (PARTITION BY Deaths.location ORDER BY Deaths.location, Deaths.date) AS RollingCount_NewVax,
  (RollingCount_NewVax/population)*100 AS TotalVaxcount  --this will give an error cos we can't call an alias column we created, using the SELECT fn.
FROM `portfolio1-337505.covid_data.covid_deaths` AS Deaths
JOIN `portfolio1-337505.covid_data.covid_vax` AS Vax
  ON Deaths.location = Vax.Location 
  AND Deaths.date = Vax.date
WHERE deaths.continent IS NOT NULL 
ORDER BY 2, 3 

--to solve the above problem, we need to use a CTE (Common Table Expression), using WITH clause
--few pointers: 
--we could do this without the MAX aggregate, and just scroll to the bottom of each location group to see the rolling TotalVaxCount
--but if we go with the MAX agg, remember to remove the date from the selected columns, as it will throw everything off
--also, get rid of the ORDER BY clause at the end, Not needed

--Now using the WITH clause to make a CTE;

WITH TotalVaxCount 
AS
 (
    SELECT 
      Deaths.continent, Deaths.location, Deaths.date, Deaths.population, Vax.new_vaccinations,

--CREATING A VIEW
--this is just like creating a temp table from any segment of your query and storing it.
-- This way, you can open it separately and query it, without affecting the main dataset.
--e.g i've copied and pasted the chunk of code below into a new tab, then "save view"

SELECT 
  Deaths.continent, Deaths.location, Deaths.date, Deaths.population, Vax.new_vaccinations, 
  SUM(Vax.new_vaccinations) OVER (PARTITION BY Deaths.location ORDER BY Deaths.location, Deaths.date) AS RollingCount_NewVax
FROM `portfolio1-337505.covid_data.covid_deaths` AS Deaths
JOIN `portfolio1-337505.covid_data.covid_vax` AS Vax
  ON Deaths.location = Vax.Location 
  AND Deaths.date = Vax.date
WHERE deaths.continent IS NOT NULL 
ORDER BY 2, 3 

--ANOTHER WAY IS TO JUST USE THE "CREATE VIEW" COMMAND.
--make sure the file name is written correctly. Below, covid_deaths was replaced with Percent_population_vaccinated, as that is the name intended for the new view

CREATE VIEW `portfolio1-337505.covid_data.Percent_population_vaccinated` AS
 SELECT Deaths.continent, Deaths.location, Deaths.date, Deaths.population, Vax.new_vaccinations, 
SUM(Vax.new_vaccinations) OVER (PARTITION BY Deaths.location ORDER BY Deaths.location, Deaths.date) AS RollingCount_NewVax
 FROM `portfolio1-337505.covid_data.covid_deaths` AS Deaths
 JOIN `portfolio1-337505.covid_data.covid_vax` AS Vax
ON Deaths.location = Vax.Location 
AND Deaths.date = Vax.date
WHERE deaths.continent IS NOT NULL 
ORDER BY 2, 3 

--now we can query the new views created as below

Select * from `portfolio1-337505.covid_data.RollingCount_sample`

Select * from `portfolio1-337505.covid_data.Percent_population_vaccinated`

--Knowing this now, you can create different views based on different parts of your query and use those for viz purposes.
